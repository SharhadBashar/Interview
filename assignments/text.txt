If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as
powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign to have
been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some
protection forever. It is in your very own skin.
