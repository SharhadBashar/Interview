# Software Engineering Coding Challenges

Below are some coding challenges that will give us some insight into your coding and problem solving abilities. Feel free to write this in whatever language you'd like. We use python at Canvass.

There isn't a hard deadline for this exercise; take as long as you need to complete it. However, in terms of total time spent actively working on the challenge, we ask that you not spend more than a few hours, as we value your time and are happy to leave things open to discussion in the onsite interview.



### Documentation:
Please provide README.md file with,

1. Instructions on how to build/run your application.
2. A paragraph or two about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, 
3. Any significant design decisions and why?



### Submission Instructions:
1. Create a new repository on github. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one.
2. Complete the project as described below.
3. Push all of your changes to your repository.
4. You should also email your recruiter to let them know you have submitted a solution. Make sure to include your github link to challenge repository in your email.



### Evaluation:
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria,

- Did you follow the instructions for submission?
- Did you document your build/deploy instructions and your explanation of what you did well?
- What design decisions did you make when designing your solutions? Why (i.e. were they explained?)
- Did you separate any concerns in your application? Why or why not?
- Does your solution use appropriate datatypes for the problem as described?



## Challenge #1:
Write a program which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number. The number obtained should be printed in a comma-sperated sequence on a single line.
Sample Output
```
2000,2002,2004,2006,2008,2020,2022,...,2886,2888
```


## Challenge #2:
Given the csv file in this directory (`random_data.csv`), read the file in and sort it by `Device_ID`, then by `Date`. Finally save the file back to a file named `random_data_sorted.csv`

> Hint: While this file is small (only 100 records), try to implement something that will work on large files with 100's of thousands or millions of records

For testing of your solution we have provided two files `random_data.csv` and `large_data.csv`
