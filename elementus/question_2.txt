For this questions, I first used a notebook, 
since its easier to view the dataframe at different stages.
I then put all the steps in a function in a .py file.

Here are the steps i took
1. I created a data.csv file with the example data.
This is what I used for the assignment.
Normally this file would come from a aws S3 bucket or something else
I would make sure to put these in a seperate data folder, and add that to the
.gitignore file, so that its not uploaded to github.
2. Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
3. Convert "currency" column to lowercase for case-insensitive grouping
4. Filter out invalid "transaction_amount" values (e.g., NaN)
5. Convert "transaction_amount" to numeric values
6. Filter only legal transactions
7. Group by currency and calculate the sum of legal transactions for each currency
8. Round values to 2 decimal places, since its currency

BONUS:
To get the sum of all legal transactions, I followed steps 1 - 6, 
and then added all the remaining columns 

The assumption I made was I assumed currencies with the same name are the same, regardless of capitalization or not
For example, I assumed BTC and btc are the same
