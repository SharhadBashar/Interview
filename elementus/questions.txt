Simple/Open instructions for Candidate for system design:

Your task is to design a chatbot system that will be used to provide users with the latest crypto news about crypto in a conversational manner. The idea is to use a Large Language Model (LLM) for orchestrating interactions with users, resolving intent from userâ€™s messages, and to provide a coherent summary for the user as a response to each message.

Assumptions:
The system can be divided into multiple components, but it will need to have a crypto news database that the LLM will need to query in order to get target crypto news to respond to the user.
No need to keep the context of the conversation, just a Q&A chatbot.
No need to train nor fine-tune the LLM component, just use it.
No need to focus on UI interfaces, just backend components.
