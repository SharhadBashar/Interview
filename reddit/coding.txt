Change Description (For Everyone)
Level 1 - Current level

Things you should know:

We care about your thought process just as much as the solution so please walk us through how you're thinking about the problem
Throughout this interview we may evolve the problem and ask you to adjust your code as necessary to meet those new requirements
Our questions are designed to scale from Intern to Principal Engineer, so you may not see every level of this question
YES, you can search for information during the interview, but please tell us you are doing that
YES, we expect you to ask questions throughout the interview
Did you know Reddit has a chat feature? Well we do! And we want to make it better.

In our real system, we have a service that manages all of the chat messages, and provides access to them through an API. For this interview, we're going to give you a function/method that behaves just like the real thing, and ask you to use it to build a new feature that lets us show more chat messages than we can right now.

If you look at the code, you'll see a function/method called get_chat_messages(), which mimics the real system. You pass in a single chat message ID, and it returns 5 messages above and below the given chat ID. The 5 messages above and below are inclusive of the given chat ID.

We want you to build a new function/method that can be given a list of chat ID's, and returns the merged output of the calls to get_chat_messages(). More explicitly, merge_messages() must:

merge the responses from the get_chat_messages() for each ID in the given list,
remove duplicates, and
return them in order.
One obvious way to do this is to put all the ID's you get back from get_chat_messages() into a set, then sort that set. But thats way too easy for a coding interview, so we're asking you to figure out a different approach.

Here is the sample input:

chat_messages = [
    {"chat_msg_id": 123.41, "message": "Hello Snoo"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 123.43, "message": "Very nice to meet"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 123.45, "message": "you."},
    {"chat_msg_id": 123.47, "message": "Hope you had wonderful"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 124.49, "message": "time so far."},
    {"chat_msg_id": 124.51, "message": "At Reddit, you’ll help"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 125.53, "message": "build something that encourages"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 126.55, "message": "millions around the world to think more"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 126.57, "message": "do more, learn more, feel more and maybe even laugh more."},
    {"chat_msg_id": 128.61, "message": "Our mission is to bring community"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 129.63, "message": "and belonging to everyone in the world"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 130.65, "message": "Our core value is to make something people love"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 132.67, "message": "Hope you"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 134.68, "message": "enjoyed this interview"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 135.53, "message": "session very much"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 135.71, "message": "and had loads of fun"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 135.73, "message": "along the way"},
    {"chat_msg_id": 135.75, "message": "as much as we did"},
]
To test your code, based on that sample input, all of the following must be verified:

Test 1: Given [123.41], the output should be

[
"Hello Snoo", 
"Very nice to meet", 
"you.", 
"Hope you had wonderful", 
"time so far."
]
Test 2:Given [124.49], the output should be

[
"Hello Snoo", 
"Very nice to meet", 
"you.", 
"Hope you had wonderful", 
"time so far.",
"At Reddit, you’ll help",
"build something that encourages",
 "millions around the world to think more",
"do more, learn more, feel more and maybe even laugh more."
]
Tests 3 & 4: Given [123.41, 135.75] or [135.75, 123.41], the output should be

[
"Hello Snoo", 
"Very nice to meet", 
"you.", 
"Hope you had wonderful", 
"time so far.",
"Hope you", 
"enjoyed this interview", 
"session very much", 
"and had loads of fun", 
"along the way",
"as much as we did"
]
Test 5: And finally, given [123.41, 124.49], the output should be

[
"Hello Snoo", 
"Very nice to meet", 
"you.", 
"Hope you had wonderful", 
"time so far.",
"At Reddit, you’ll help",
"build something that encourages",
 "millions around the world to think more",
"do more, learn more, feel more and maybe even laugh more."
