Solid software design 

concurrency in python

implement dictionary in python -> how hash tables work, collisions

Given an array of n+1 integers with values in [1, n].
There is exactly one duplicated number.
Write a function "find_duplicate" that takes an array of integers and returns the duplicated number

from collections import Counter

def find_duplicate(arr):
    arr_count = Counter(arr)
    for key, value in arr_count.items():
        if value == 2:
            return key
    return -1

def find_duplicate_2(arr):
    arr_set = set()
    for i in arr:
        try:
            value = arr_set.get(i)
            return value
        except:
            arr_set.add(i)
    return -1
    
    
find_duplicate_2([2, 3, 2, 1])
