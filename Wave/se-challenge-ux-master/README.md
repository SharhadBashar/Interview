# Wave UI/UX Engineering Challenge

Applicants for the UI/UX Engineer role at Wave must complete the following challenge, and submit a solution prior to the on-site technical interview.

The purpose of this exercise is to create something that we can work on together during the on-site. We do this so that you get a chance to collaborate with Wavers during the interview in a situation where you know something better than us (it's your code, after all!).  

We also want to give you a feel of what you could expect to work on in this role.
You will be required to work extensively with React in this role, so we would like to evaluate your skills using React with this exercise.

There isn't a hard deadline for this exercise; take as long as you need to complete it. However, in terms of total time spent actively working on the challenge, we ask that you not spend more than a few hours, as we value your time and are happy to leave things open to discussion in the on-site interview.

Feel free to email dev.careers@waveapps.com if you have any questions.

## Scenario
Imagine that the design team at Wave has recognized two places that use a similar UI component to provide **insights** to our users. We want to formalize this by implementing a reusable component in our design library. (Think of this component as a Lego block that can be used in multiple places.)


You have been provided with this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/AALOx1yqhdDfTbBsVyT1Hb/?node-id=0%3A1) outlining the design details of this component. (You will be able to view the file without an account, but will need to be logged into a free Figma account to view elements' detailed properties in Figma's Inspect panel). If you are not familiar with using Figma, start on [this page](https://www.figma.com/file/AALOx1yqhdDfTbBsVyT1Hb/UI%2FUX-Engineer-Take-Home-Exercise?node-id=10%3A702) where we have included some basic tips on using the tool. Please use your judgement when referencing the CSS generated by Figma in the Inspect panel, as it's often overcomplicated or includes unnecessary properties.

## Project requirements


1. Implement the Insights component as a React component, using Typescript or Javascript. (The project is set up to support either, but there are bonus points for using Typescript.)

2.  Implement styling for the Insights component using SCSS or vanilla CSS. (The project is set up to support either.)  
    a) The Figma designs use [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lato:wght@400;700) as the font (Regular and Bold). This font is available through Google fonts.  
    b) Do not use Styled Components as our current ecosystem does not support this and we want to evaluate you based on what you’ll actually be working with in this role.

3. Use Typescript or PropTypes to define appropriate datatypes for your component.
4. Implement the component to work **on at least one** of the following sizes as defined in the Figma file:  
    a) Wide screen sizes  
    b) Medium screen sizes  
    c) Narrow screen sizes
5. Update the [App.tsx](./src/App.tsx) file to render/use your insights component.
6. Optional: Write test(s) for your component.
We know you might be pressed for time, so we won’t consider the absence of tests as a negative. (The project is set up to use Enzyme or React Testing Library)
