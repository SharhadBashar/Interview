    "- This exam integrates knowledge and skills acquired in the first half of the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using AI agents/chatbots such as ChatGPT and Copilot is considered an act of cheating and you will receive 0 mark for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to use any other resources on your computer or the internet, but you are **not** allowed to share documents, post questions to forums such as Stack Overflow (this includes use of homework helpers such as Chegg), or communicate in anyway with people inside or outside the exam room.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having any communication tools (*e.g.*, Discord, Teams, Slack, Outlook etc.) either web-based or app-based open on your computer (or having them running in the background) is considered an act of cheating and you will receive 0 mark for the exam.\n",

    "- To finish the midterm in the alloted time, you will have to work efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please read the entirety of each question carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You must have your work submitted by 6:30PM to the \"Assignments\" section of the course's site on OWL, *i.e.*, the same place where you originally downloaded the notebook. Late submissions will be scored with 0 mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To avoid technical difficulties at the time of submission, please initiate your submission process at the latest five minutes before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some questions demand a **written answer**. Please answer these in full English sentences in a markdown cell right underneath the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For your figures ensure that all axes are labeled in an informative way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the end, before submitting to OWL, restart the kernel and rerun all cells to make sure that your notebook runs error free and as expected.\n",

    "- If you have no clue how to approach a question, skip it, and move on. Revisit the skipped one(s) after you are done with other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where applicable, take advantage of the argument `n_jobs=-1` to speed up processes with parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To navigate within the notebook, better to take advantage of the notebook's table of contents (normally on the left side of the screen). It saves you some time compared to pure scrolling with the mouse. In VScode, it is nested under the \"OUTLINE\" tab which is by default minimized unless you click it to maximize.\n",

    "Load the dataset as a pandas dataframe and perform the following steps:\n",
    "1. Display its first five rows. <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "2. Print out the number of rows and columns of it? <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "3. Print out the count for each variable type? For example, if you have a dataframe with 5 columns of which 2 are `int64` and 3 are `float64`, your printed output will be like: `float64` 3, `int64` 2. <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "4. Print out the count of rows with missing values. Drop those rows from the dataframe, if any. <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "5. Remove the `Id` column from your dataframe. <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "6. Find the age of the properties using `YearBuilt` variable and replace `YearBuilt` with the new variable `PropertyAge`. For this purpose, use the current year as reference. <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "7. Use `YrSold` variable to calculate how many years ago the property was sold and name that new coulmn `YrsSinceSale` and replace `YrSold`. <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "8. Encode all categorical columns using One-hot encoding. We want to get $k-1$ dummies out of $k$ categorical levels. How many new columns were added to the dataframe? <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "9. Eventually, we want to a binary classification of properties based on their `SalePrice`. In order to prepare the data for that stage, here we want to bin `SalePrice` based on its median value, *i.e.*, if a property's `SalePrice` is above or equal to the median value of the vector `SalePrice`, the property's `SalePrice` value gets replaced with 1, otherwise 0. <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>\n",
    "10. Report the count of ones and zeros in your updated `SalePrice` attribute. Taking it as the target for classification, will that be a balanced or imbalanced classification problem? <span style=\"color:green\">[2]</span>"

    "Generally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves should be used when there are roughly equal numbers of observations for each class. Precision-Recall (PR) curves should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance. Given this information, choose the right type of curve for your winner model and plot it for both training and test sets, also, report the AUC for both sets."
